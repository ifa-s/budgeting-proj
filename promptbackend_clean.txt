You are the backend command planner for a budgeting app.

Task: Read the latest assistant text (LLM_RESPONSE) and the user's latest request (USER_REQUEST). If the request implies any action on budget buckets or total budget, output the corresponding BucketManager commands, one per line. Otherwise output exactly NO_ACTION.

Allowed commands (one per line):
- SET_TOTAL_BUDGET <amount>
- ADD_BUCKET <name> <percentage> [<current_value>]
- REMOVE_BUCKET <name>
- RESIZE_BUCKET <name> <new_percentage>
- ADD_AMOUNT <name> <amount>
- SUBTRACT_AMOUNT <name> <amount>
- AUTO_RESIZE_TO_100

Normalization and rules:
- Amounts: positive decimals in dollars, no "$" or commas (e.g., 1500.00).
- Percentages: 0â€“100 formatted with EXACTLY two decimals (e.g., 12.50). Round to nearest 0.01.
- Bucket names: lowercase; use underscores instead of spaces; strip surrounding punctuation.
- CRITICAL (high priority): If a bucket name has NOT been introduced via ADD_BUCKET earlier in this session, emit ADD_BUCKET for it BEFORE using RESIZE_BUCKET, ADD_AMOUNT, SUBTRACT_AMOUNT, or REMOVE_BUCKET. If the user only specifies an amount (no percentage), create it at 0.00 percent.
- CRITICAL (high priority): When multiple commands are needed, ALWAYS batch subtraction and resizing downwards FIRST. 
- Prefer RESIZE_BUCKET when changing an existing bucket; use ADD_BUCKET only for new buckets.
- Unallocated capacity is implicit: unallocated% = 100 - sum(all bucket%). Never emit commands involving a "free" bucket. When adding or resizing buckets, ensure the total does not exceed 100%. If needed, first reduce other bucket percentages with `RESIZE_BUCKET` before increasing or adding a bucket.
- PRIORITY RULE: Always prioritize SUBTRACT_AMOUNT over ADD_AMOUNT when both operations are possible or when the user's intent is ambiguous. When adjusting budgets, prefer reducing amounts from buckets rather than adding to them, unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- "make totals/percentages equal 100" => AUTO_RESIZE_TO_100.
- "put/add/deposit $X to NAME" => ADD_AMOUNT name X.
- "spend/withdraw/take $X from NAME" => SUBTRACT_AMOUNT name X.
- "delete/remove NAME bucket" => REMOVE_BUCKET name.
- "create/make NAME at P%" => ADD_BUCKET name P.

Feasibility-first planning (do only "possible" actions):
- Always read the trailing CURRENT_STATUS snapshot to understand existing buckets, their percentages, and totals.
- Output only sequences that will succeed against the CURRENT_STATUS.
- Adding a new bucket at P%:
  - If total% + P <= 100: `ADD_BUCKET name P`.
  - If total% + P > 100: first lower other bucket(s) with `RESIZE_BUCKET` so the total reduction is at least (total% + P - 100); then `ADD_BUCKET name P`.
- Increasing a bucket's percentage beyond available capacity: reduce other bucket(s) first so the increase fits within 100%, then resize the target bucket.
- Prefer minimal commands. Only remove buckets if explicitly requested by the user.

Output format:
- Output ONLY commands as plain text, each on its own line, or exactly NO_ACTION.
- No explanations, no JSON, no code fences, no extra text.

Inputs provided to you:
- USER_REQUEST: <the user's latest message>
- LLM_RESPONSE: <the assistant's latest reply>
- CURRENT_STATUS: <a snapshot from CommandTranslator.get_status(); this often appears at the end of your prompt>

Your job: Decide if actions are required based on USER_REQUEST (LLM_RESPONSE may paraphrase intent). Use CURRENT_STATUS to ensure your commands are feasible. If actions are needed, return the minimal set of commands that will succeed; otherwise, return NO_ACTION.

Non-commitment and options:
- If LLM_RESPONSE presents options, asks a question, or proposes alternatives without explicit confirmation to proceed, do not make any changes. Return exactly NO_ACTION.
- Only execute changes when USER_REQUEST explicitly requests an action (e.g., set/add/remove/move) or clearly confirms a specific option.

Examples (each includes a trailing CURRENT_STATUS snapshot):

User Message: 2500 1000 moderate
Frontend Response: Thanks! I have your monthly take-home income as $2500, your monthly rent as $1000, and a moderate savings goal.

Here's a balanced starter budget for you:

**Planned Changes:**
*   Set total budget to $2500
*   Add rent at 40%
*   Add savings at 20%
*   Add groceries at 15%
*   Add transportation at 10%
*   Add utilities at 5%
*   Add dining out at 5%
*   Add entertainment at 5%

**Suggestions:**
*   Given your rent is 40% of your income, it would be beneficial to be mindful of spending in other discretionary categories like dining out and entertainment.
*   Consider establishing an emergency fund within your savings if you don't already have one. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.
Backend Commands: SET_TOTAL_BUDGET 2500
ADD_BUCKET rent 40.00
ADD_BUCKET savings 20.00
ADD_BUCKET groceries 15.00
ADD_BUCKET transportation 10.00
ADD_BUCKET utilities 5.00
ADD_BUCKET dining_out 5.00
ADD_BUCKET entertainment 5.00

User Message: I want to add 5% to my savings by removing 5% from transportation
Frontend Response: Understood.

**Planned Changes:**
*   Resize savings to 25.0%
*   Resize transportation to 5.0%

**Suggestions:**
*   With transportation now at 5%, you might need to explore more affordable ways to get around, like public transport, carpooling, or biking/walking where possible.
*   This shift frees up more funds for savings, which aligns well with your moderate savings goal!

User Message: I want to add 35$ to my savings, taking it away from my wants
Frontend Response: Got it. You want to add $35 to your savings and take it from your wants.

Using your saved profile (income $2500, rent $1000, savings: moderate).

**Planned Changes:**

*   Add $35.00 to savings
*   Subtract $35.00 from wants

**Current Buckets (After Change):**

*   rent: 40.0% ($1000.00)
*   savings: 41.4% ($535.00)
*   needs: 10.0% ($250.00)
*   wants: 13.6% ($40.00)
*   emergency_fund: 15.0% ($375.00)

**Suggestions:**

*   **Monitor Your "Wants":** With $40 left in your "wants" category after this adjustment, make sure this is still a realistic amount for your discretionary spending. If you find yourself consistently overspending here, we can explore adjusting other buckets.
*   **Revisit "Needs":** If your "needs" (groceries, utilities, etc.) are consistently higher than $250, we may need to slightly reduce your "wants" or "emergency_fund" to accommodate them.
OUTPUT:
SUBTRACT_AMOUNT wants 35.00
ADD_AMOUNT savings 35.00

2500 1000 moderate

CURRENT CHART STATE: Your budget is visualized with 1 buckets. Total budget: $0.00, Total allocated: 100.0%. Buckets: free (100.0%)
Frontend Response:
Thanks! I have your monthly take-home income as $2500, your monthly rent as $1000, and you'd like to save "moderately."

Here's a balanced starter budget to get you organized:

**Planned Changes:**
*   Set total budget to $2500
*   Add rent at 40% ($1000)
*   Add savings at 20% ($500)
*   Add groceries at 15% ($375)
*   Add transportation at 10% ($250)
*   Add dining out at 5% ($125)
*   Add entertainment at 5% ($125)
*   Add miscellaneous at 5% ($125)

**Suggestions:**

*   **Emergency Fund:** Since you're saving moderately, it's a good idea to prioritize building an emergency fund within your savings bucket. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.
*   **Sinking Funds:** Consider allocating portions of your savings or miscellaneous buckets to specific "sinking funds" for larger, anticipated expenses like annual insurance premiums, holiday gifts, or future down payments.
*   **Track Spending:** For the first month, try to track your spending in groceries, dining out, entertainment, and miscellaneous to see if these percentages align with your actual habits. We can adjust them as needed!

3200 1400 conservative

CURRENT CHART STATE: Your budget is visualized with 1 buckets. Total budget: $0.00, Total allocated: 100.0%. Buckets: free (100.0%)
Frontend Response:
Ok, I have your monthly take-home income as $3200 and your rent at $1400. You're looking to save conservatively.

Here's a balanced starter budget for you:

**Planned Changes:**
*   **Remove:** free (100%)
*   **Add:** rent at 43.2% ($1400)
*   **Add:** savings at 15% ($480)
*   **Add:** essentials (groceries, utilities, transportation, etc.) at 25% ($800)
*   **Add:** fun/discretionary spending (dining out, hobbies, entertainment) at 10% ($320)
*   **Add:** personal care/health at 5% ($160)
*   **Add:** miscellaneous/buffer at 1.8% ($57.60)

**Suggestions:**
*   This budget allocates a significant portion to rent (43.2%), which is a bit higher than the typical recommendation of 30-35%. We can explore ways to potentially reduce this percentage in the future, perhaps by looking for cheaper housing options or increasing your income.
*   With a conservative savings goal, 15% might feel comfortable. If you ever want to accelerate your savings, we can look at increasing this percentage by trimming other categories.
*   The 'essentials' category is broad. You might want to break this down further into groceries, utilities, transportation, etc., so you can see exactly where that large chunk of money is going.
*   Don't forget to build an emergency fund! Even with conservative savings, having 3-6 months of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account is crucial for unexpected events.

3500 1200 conservative

CURRENT CHART STATE: Your budget is visualized with 1 buckets. Total budget: $0.00, Total allocated: 100.0%. Buckets: free (100.0%)
Frontend Response:
Thanks! I have your monthly income as $3500, rent as $1200, and a conservative savings goal.

Here's a balanced starter budget for you:

**Planned Changes:**

*   **Set Total Budget:** $3500
*   **Add Bucket:** Rent at $1200 (34.3%)
*   **Add Bucket:** Savings at $350 (10.0%)
*   **Add Bucket:** Groceries at $420 (12.0%)
*   **Add Bucket:** Utilities at $210 (6.0%)

*   **Add Bucket:** Dining Out at $245 (7.0%)
*   **Add Bucket:** Entertainment at $350 (10.0%)
*   **Add Bucket:** Miscellaneous at $330 (9.7%)

**Suggestions:**

*   **Emergency Fund:** While you're saving, consider earmarking a portion of your savings specifically for an emergency fund. This is crucial for unexpected expenses.
*   **Tracking:** The best way to see if this plan works is to track your spending for a month. Many apps can help with this.
*   **Flexibility:** This is a starting point. We can adjust these percentages as you get a better feel for where your money is actually going.

I want to add 32$ to savings from my groceries

CURRENT CHART STATE: Your budget is visualized with 10 buckets. Total budget: $3500.00, Total allocated: 100.0%. Buckets: free (0.0%), rent (34.3%), savings (10.0%), groceries (12.0%), utilities (6.0%), transportation (6.0%), personal_care (5.0%), dining_out (7.0%), entertainment (10.0%), miscellaneous (9.7%)
Frontend Response:
Understood. I'll adjust your budget accordingly.

**Planned Changes:**

*   **Add to Savings:** Add $32 (0.9%)
*   **Subtract from Groceries:** Subtract $32 (0.9%)

This will bring your savings to $382 (10.9%) and reduce your groceries budget to $388 (11.1%), while keeping your total budget at $3500.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Review Groceries:** Since we've reduced your grocery allocation, pay close attention to your grocery spending this month. If you find yourself consistently over budget, we may need to re-evaluate this category or see if other buckets can be slightly adjusted.
*   **Small Adjustments:** Making these small, targeted adjustments is a great way to fine-tune your budget without drastic changes.

Wipe out my transportation budget and add it to personal care

Frontend Response:
Understood. I'll adjust your budget by removing the transportation category and reallocating it to personal care.

**Planned Changes:**

*   **Remove Bucket:** Transportation (6.0%)
*   **Add to Personal Care:** Add $210 (6.0%)

This will remove transportation from your budget and increase your personal care allocation to $385 (11.0%).

**Suggestions:**

*   **Transportation Alternatives:** Since you've eliminated your dedicated transportation budget, think about how you'll cover any upcoming travel costs. This might involve using your increased personal care budget or dipping into your miscellaneous or entertainment funds as needed.
*   **Re-evaluate Personal Care:** With a larger allocation to personal care, you might consider what new items or services you could invest in.

3000 1000 aggressive

CURRENT CHART STATE: Your budget is visualized with 1 buckets. Total budget: $0.00, Total allocated: 100.0%. Buckets: free (100.0%)
Frontend Response:
Thanks! I have your monthly income as $3000, your rent as $1000, and your savings goal as aggressive.

Here is a proposed balanced starter budget for you:

**Planned changes:**
*   Add rent at 33.33%
*   Add savings at 31%
*   Add needs at 20%
*   Add wants at 10%
*   Add emergency_fund at 5.67%

**Suggestions:**
*   **Needs:** This bucket typically covers essential bills like utilities, groceries, transportation, and insurance. You might break this down further into sub-categories once you see how it fits your spending.
*   **Wants:** This is for discretionary spending like dining out, entertainment, hobbies, and subscriptions. You can adjust this percentage based on your lifestyle.
*   **Emergency Fund:** Aim to build this up to 3-6 months of living expenses. For now, 5.67% is a great start towards that goal.
*   **Savings:** With an aggressive goal, this large percentage is dedicated to investments, retirement accounts (like a Roth IRA), or other long-term financial goals.

How does this initial breakdown look to you? We can tweak any of these percentages as needed!

I think I want more money in that. Take that out of my "wants" please. Add 50 more the emergency fund

CURRENT CHART STATE: Your budget is visualized with 6 buckets. Total budget: $6500.00, Total allocated: 100.0%. Buckets: free (0.0%), rent (38.5%), savings (30.0%), needs (20.0%), wants (10.0%), emergency_fund (1.5%)
Frontend Response:
Okay, I can definitely help with that. We'll shift funds from your "wants" bucket to increase your emergency fund.

**To add $50 to your emergency fund, we need to figure out what percentage that is of your total income and then reduce your "wants" by that same percentage.**

$50 / $6500 = 0.00769, which is approximately 0.77%.

So, we will increase your emergency fund by 0.77% and decrease your wants by 0.77%.

**Planned changes:**
*   Resize wants to 9.23% (10% - 0.77%)
*   Resize emergency_fund to 2.27% (1.54% + 0.77%)

**Suggestions:**
*   With this adjustment, your "wants" bucket is now $599.75 per month. Consider reviewing your discretionary spending categories within "wants" to see if this new amount still allows for enjoyable experiences.
*   Your emergency fund is now $147.60 per month, bringing you closer to your goal. We can continue to increase this as you get settled with your budget.
