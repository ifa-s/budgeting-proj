## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set up your OpenRouter API Key
Create a `.env` file in the project root (same directory as README.md):
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your OpenRouter API key:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure your virtual environment is activated:
```bash
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Database Migrations
```bash
cd budgeting_app
python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 5. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## How It Works

### Frontend-Backend Integration
- The Django app creates a `UserClient` instance from your backend
- Chat messages are processed through your `user_client.process_user_input()` method
- **Real-time chart synchronization** - Charts display actual bucket data from the backend
- **AI chart awareness** - The AI knows about current chart state and bucket allocations
- **Accurate data extraction** - Bucket percentages, amounts, and names pulled directly from BucketManager
- The interface handles both frontend AI responses and backend command execution

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Main chat interface
- `POST /start/` - Initialize conversation
- `POST /send/` - Send message and get AI response
- `GET /status/` - Get current bucket status

### File Structure
```
budgeting_app/
├── chat/                    # Django app for chat interface
│   ├── templates/chat/      # HTML templates
│   ├── views.py            # API views connecting to backend
│   └── urls.py             # URL routing
├── budgeting_app/          # Django project settings
└── manage.py               # Django management script
```

## Usage
1. Start the server and open the chat interface
2. The AI will greet you automatically
3. Start by telling the AI about your income or financial situation
4. Ask it to create spending buckets, set budgets, or track expenses
5. **Watch the real-time charts update** as you interact:
   - **Budget Allocation Chart** - Shows how your money is distributed across buckets
   - **Spending Timeline** - Tracks your budget changes over time
   - **Live Stats** - Real-time budget totals and allocation percentages
   - **Smart Recommendations** - AI-generated financial advice checklist
6. **Check off recommendations** as you complete financial tasks
7. **Toggle between light and dark themes** using the 🌙/☀️ button in the header
8. The header will show real-time updates of your budget status

- Check Django logs for any import or configuration errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed in your virtual environment
